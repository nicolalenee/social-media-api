# social-media-api

## Description
This project creates the API endpoints and backend databases for a social media website. Social media websites thrive by having a robust data organization system to allow users a more personalized experience when requesting data. As these websites and applications grow, it's imperative that data is stored in a way that makes sense to the way that users will interact with that data. To accomodate for eventually dealing with big data, this application was organized with a noSQL framework through MongoDB.

## Technologies
* Node.Js
* Express.Js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

## Installation
Initialize the application by running the `npm run start` command. Since this is project only contains a backend, a third party API service such as Insomnia or Postman will need to be used to test the routes. 

## User Stories
Users will be able to create or delete a user profile with a username and email address, add thoughts and add or remove friends. Users will also be able to remove thoughts and add or remove reactions to those thoughts. Users will also be able to get a list of all the current users and their correspondinig thoughts and friends.


## Usage
Once the server has been started, users can navigate to their API application and run the appropriate requests to perform CRUD methods on the data
