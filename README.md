# social-media-api

## Description
This project creates the API endpoints and backend databases for a social media website. Social media websites thrive by having a robust data organization system to allow users a more personalized experience when calling data. As these websites and applications grow, it's imperative that data is stored in a way that makes sense to the way that users will interact with that data. 

## Technologies
This project was built with a No-SQL framework; MongoDB was used to create and organize the database and collections. MongooseDB was used to create these relations with JavaScript. 

## Installation
This application can be run by downloading the repository and running the `npm run start` command. Since this is project only contains a back-end, a third party HTTP request service such as Insomnia or Postman will need to be used to test the Routes. 

## User Stories
Users will be able to create or delete a user profile with a username and email address, add thoughts and add or remove friends. Users will also be able to remove thoughts and add or remove reactions to those thoughts. Users will also be able to get a list of all the current users and their correspondinig thoughts and friends.
